Reinforcement Memory Network
From Weiwei Zhang (260 684 686)

In my final project I applied DQN (Deep Q-learning) to Memory Networks.

File list,

_QMemN2N.ipynb_ is my project report and core code of my implementation.

_Reinforcement Memory Networks.pdf_ is the presentation slides.

Folder _code_ contains all my code files. Need tensorflow, keras and numpy installed.
